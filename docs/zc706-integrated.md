# ZC706 integrated acquisition and clock discipline

Development target: `make integrated-pl`. This reuses the qualified dual-card
ADC/DDR target and the SFP subsystem, adding two original WR DDMTD detectors.
Physical integration validation is pending; standalone subsystem results do not
qualify this target.

The DDR controller remains at 83 1/3 MHz, with its qualified MMCM and BUFG
placements. The WR helper is derived directly from PS FCLK0 (100 MHz), at
98.4375 MHz; both ADC sample clocks are compared to FCLK0. ADC receivers and
DMA retain independent domains and asynchronous FIFOs. PLL locking does not
establish a shared acquisition epoch.

CSR banks 1–15 retain the ADC/DDR ABI. Reciprocal counters occupy 16–18,
WR phase detectors 19–20, and SFP diagnostics/MAC/packet test 21–23.
Reciprocal timestamps use the DDR system clock; software uses the exported
reference frequency rather than assuming 100 MHz. Phase units remain 10/63 ns.
SFP uses the physically qualified PS FCLK 100 MHz reference, the existing MAC/IP and UDP echo port.
Board I2C is shared by control software; it must have one owner per transaction.

Initialize DDR and train both receivers before starting the dual PLL runner
with `--preinitialized`. Do not initialize/reset receivers while acquisition
or the PLL control loop is running. No flash, OTP or default SD boot changes.

Build and verification commands:

```sh
make integrated-pl integrated-software
python3 tools/test_integrated_hardware.py --host BOARD_IP --program --output build/zc706-integrated/hardware
```

The host wrapper first trains DDR and performs full-capacity BIST.
It then trains both receivers before the phase-control run.
The host wrapper owns the ZC706 lock throughout JTAG boot, training and tests.
It uses volatile JTAG programming, verifies uploaded file hashes and retains
logs, phase records and board-side capture results. The initial test includes
1,000 complete SFP MAC/PCS/GTX loopback packets. External tests use ICMP and
byte-exact UDP echo through the switch while acquisition and PLL control run.

Regression checks passed: independent-clock ADC DMA simulation (stalls,
overflow, reset, frame failure, invalid configuration), original WR dual
DDMTD simulation, PI model, I2C fault handling and parallel control ownership.
Standalone SFP register addresses and widths remain unchanged; the reference-monitor constant is additive.

Clock-placement findings: unconstrained TX MMCM placement could not route a
clock to its BUFG. The target retains the qualified SFP TX MMCM/BUFG sites,
DDR sites and reserves other available MMCMs for RX, the WR helper and ADC2.
The dense design also exposed an expensive MMCM-LOCKED to GTX-TXUSERRDY
route. The integrated target synchronizes each SFP MMCM LOCKED output through two
SYS flip-flops placed adjacent to the MMCM, before all downstream consumers
(including TXUSERRDY and reset logic); the isolated target keeps its qualified
behavior. This
delays READY until the user clock is stable and still requires physical
startup/loopback validation.

The qualified isolated SFP image uses FCLK; the Si5324 inter-quad path remains
unqualified. External switch operation was NOT_RUN in that qualification
because module EEPROM returned NACK. The integrated wrapper attempts the
external test and records PARTIAL rather than PASS if it fails, even when
DDR, both ADC streams, both PLLs and internal SFP loopback pass.

During concurrent DDR readback the bounded PLL process uses SCHED_FIFO
priority 10, inherited by its two native I2C workers. Each control iteration
sleeps, I2C failures have bounded timeouts, and the process terminates after
120 seconds, restoring both RFREQ settings. DDR readback uses normal priority.
This protects control deadlines from a CPU-bound diagnostic reader; the
reported phase statistics must still pass during the actual readback interval.

Two optional SFP reference-clock diagnostic counters are omitted in the
integrated target (`SFP_REFERENCE_MONITORS=0`), freeing their two BUFGs and
clock domains. Their CSR values stay zero; TX/RX frequency counters, PHY/PLL
flags and DRP remain active. The isolated SFP target retains both monitors.
The initial placement used twelve distinct BUFG clocks in each of two regions.

An isolated backend extension fixes router1's consistency check for a
reserved source wire before any sink arc is routed. Other wires remain
subject to the full consistency check. `NEXTPNR_ROUTE_SNAPSHOT` optionally
saves the placed state at routing entry to speed backend experiments.
